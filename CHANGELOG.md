[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); versions follow
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html). `scripts/release`
turns the `Unreleased` section into a dated release.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Diversity and turnover in the growth curve: `vessel/curve.csv` gains `killed`, `shannon`, `dominance`,
  `mean_gen`, `arisen`, `extinct`, `pheromone`, `mutations_ready` and `mutations_taken`, sampled every
  10 ticks like the rest. `Dish.metrics()`, `Culture.metrics()` and `bio.curve.read()` expose them; the
  vitals panel and `biotic status` show diversity next to the strain count, and `biotic run` prints H in
  its progress line. See `docs/curve.md`.

### Changed

- A `curve.csv` written before this release is widened in place the first time the culture appends to
  it: older rows keep their values and have empty cells in the new columns. Logged once as a `curve` event
  (`≡` in the incubator log). A file re-saved by a spreadsheet, with a byte-order mark, is recognised.
- A `curve.csv` the culture cannot read or write no longer stops the dish: the failure is logged once as a
  `curve` event, every later row is tried again, and a `resumed` event says when writing works.
- The vitals `strains` row reads `living  arisen  extinct`; the maximum generation it used to show is
  replaced by the cell-weighted mean generation on the new `diversity` row.

### Fixed

- An empty `curve.csv`, or one holding only blank lines, is given its header with the next row instead
  of being appended to without one.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-09

### Added

- The dish: an elliptical agar grid with nutrient diffusion, pheromone, energetics, senescence, and lysis.
- Genomes as `live(me)` functions, gated by the membrane (static AST rules, a wall-clock budget, a smoke test).
- The mutagen: a background thread that asks any OpenAI-compatible model for daughter genomes on division.
- The eyepiece: a live terminal view of the culture, its vitals, census, and incubator log.
- `biotic seed | live | run | status | strains | genome | log | whisper | drop | minds | probe | sterilize`.
- The fossil record: every strain that ever arose is written to `soma/`.
